# HTML-Project
##This is the html project of a website for a pastry shop in my neighborhood.
This project is to see the level of html and css of the students, my goal is to create a competent website and be able to publish it so that this business has a "professional" website so that its clients can obtain more information about the establishment of products and try to considerably increase income.
